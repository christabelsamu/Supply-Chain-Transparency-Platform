# Supply Chain Transparency Platform

A blockchain-based solution providing end-to-end transparency and verification for product supply chains.

## Overview

The Supply Chain Transparency Platform leverages smart contracts to create an immutable record of products as they move through the supply chain. The platform enables manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, retailers, and consumers to verify the authenticity, origin, and quality of products.

## Core Components

### Product Registration Contract

Tracks individual products throughout their lifecycle:
- Creates unique digital identities for each product
- Records origins, manufacturing details, and components
- Logs ownership transfers across the supply chain
- Maintains comprehensive product history from creation to consumer

### Supplier Verification Contract

Manages and validates supplier credentials:
- Stores supplier information and digital identities
- Tracks certifications (organic, fair trade, sustainability)
- Verifies compliance with regulatory standards
- Enables reputation scoring based on performance metrics

### Quality Assurance Contract

Documents quality control throughout the supply chain:
- Records inspection results and quality checkpoints
- Maintains testing data and compliance verification
- Triggers alerts for quality issues or deviations
- Links quality data to specific product batches or individual items

### Consumer Verification Contract

Empowers end users with product information:
- Provides authentication mechanisms (QR codes, NFC tags)
- Displays complete product journey and provenance
- Shows certifications and quality assurance results
- Enables consumer feedback and reporting

## Technical Architecture

The platform is built on a blockchain infrastructure that ensures:
- Data immutability and tamper resistance
- Decentralized verification mechanisms
- Transparent audit trails
- Secure identity management
- Interoperability with existing supply chain systems

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ethereum wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- Access to Ethereum network (Mainnet or supported testnet)
- Node.js and npm (for development)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/supply-chain-platform.git
   cd supply-chain-platform
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. Deploy contracts
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your-network>
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Registering a New Product
```javascript
// Example code for manufacturers
const productId = await productRegistrationContract.registerProduct(
  productDetails,
  originLocation,
  manufacturingData,
  componentsList
);
```

### Verifying a Supplier
```javascript
// Example code for onboarding new suppliers
const isVerified = await supplierVerificationContract.verifyCertifications(
  supplierId,
  certificationDocuments,
  expirationDates
);
```

### Recording Quality Checks
```javascript
// Example code for quality inspectors
await qualityAssuranceContract.recordInspection(
  productBatchId,
  inspectionResults,
  inspectorId,
  timestamp
);
```

### Consumer Product Verification
```javascript
// Example code for consumer-facing applications
const productHistory = await consumerVerificationContract.getProductJourney(productId);
```

## Integration Options
